    "**Within the expansion of the Internet and Web, there has also been a growing interest in online articles and reviews, which allows an easy and fast spread of information worldwide. Thus, predicting the popularity of online news has become a trend. Popularity is often measured by considering the number of interactions in the Web and social networks (e.g., number of shares, likes, and comments). Predicting such popularity is valuable for advertisers, authors, content providers, and even activists/politicians (e.g., to understand or influence public opinion). In this assignment, we use a news popularity dataset utilized by Fernandes et al. (2015) based on the articles published by [Mashable](https://mashable.com/) from January 7, 2013, to January 7, 2015.**\n",
